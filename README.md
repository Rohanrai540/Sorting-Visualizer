## Key Features:
1. Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
2. Array Generation: Random arrays of different sizes can be generated to demonstrate sorting algorithms on different scales.
3. Visualization: The sorting process is visualized in real-time through animations, allowing users to see how elements are rearranged during the sorting process.
4. Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different rates, from slow-motion to fast-forward.
5. User Interaction: Interactive controls allow users to pause, play, or reset the visualization at any point, providing an immersive learning experience.
6. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility for users.
## Technologies Used:
 HTML: Provides the structure and markup for the web page.
 CSS: Styles the visual elements and layout of the application.
 JavaScript: Implements the sorting algorithms, handles user interactions, and animates the sorting process.
## Purpose:
The Sorting Visualizer project serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts to gain a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms by visualizing their behavior in a fun and interactive manner. It can be used for self-learning, classroom demonstrations, or as a supplement to algorithmic studies.
## Conclusion:
The Sorting Visualizer project offers an intuitive and engaging platform for exploring sorting algorithms, making complex concepts accessible and enjoyable for learners of all levels.
